# Ideas





## Stravu

* Connect to Stravu MCP API to fetch notebook content with PRDs
* Track progress of PRDs (imagine it submitting screenshots into Stravu from test runs)


## Cool

* Audio transcription
  * Let me talk to it with whisper
* Todo tracking
  * Grab the todo sets from the output and keep it as a running list that's always visible on the sidebar so i can see how far it has gotten
