1. When creating a new project, check (after doing git init if that hasn't been done) if there is a .gitignore and if that .gitignore covers the worktree folder. Give a popup asking if they would like to add it, and if so add it and commit.
2. Each time I make a new project it shows the getting started again. Kind of unexpected behavior to me. 
3. Make running with --dangerously-ignore-permissions an option. Build out a UX for approving changes.
