# Claude Code Commander - Feature Suggestions

## Executive Summary

After a comprehensive analysis of the Claude Code Commander (CCC) codebase, I've identified several opportunities for enhancement that would significantly improve developer productivity, collaboration capabilities, and overall user experience. The application already has a solid foundation with session management, git worktree integration, real-time updates, and conversation persistence. These suggestions build upon that foundation to create an even more powerful development tool.

## 1. Collaboration & Sharing Features

### 1.1 Session Sharing & Export
**Problem:** Currently, sessions are isolated to individual developers. Sharing insights or approaches requires manual copy/paste.

**Solution:** Implement session sharing capabilities:
- **Share Links:** Generate shareable read-only links for sessions (with optional expiration)
- **Export Formats:** Export sessions as:
  - Markdown documents with formatted conversation history
  - JSON for re-import into other CCC instances
  - HTML reports with syntax highlighting
- **Conversation Templates:** Save successful session patterns as reusable templates

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// New API endpoints
POST /api/sessions/:id/share
GET /api/shared/:shareId
POST /api/sessions/:id/export
POST /api/templates
```

### 1.2 Team Collaboration Mode
**Problem:** No built-in way for teams to coordinate parallel approaches to complex problems.

**Solution:** Add team collaboration features:
- **Session Groups:** Group related sessions working on the same problem
- **Real-time Activity Feed:** See what other team members are working on
- **Session Annotations:** Add notes and tags to sessions for team visibility
- **Merge Suggestions:** AI-powered suggestions for combining successful approaches

## 2. Enhanced Git Integration
