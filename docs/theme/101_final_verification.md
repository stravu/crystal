# Checking for: focus:ring-* with color values
# Result: 0 instances
```

### 5. Special Cases Verified
- ✅ All scrollbar colors in index.css migrated
- ✅ All body colors using design tokens
- ✅ SessionInputWithImages.tsx fully migrated
- ✅ ProjectDashboardSkeleton.tsx divide colors migrated
- ✅ Discord brand colors preserved (#5865F2, etc.)

## Files with Intentional Exceptions

### 1. **Settings.tsx**
- Contains 6 commented-out hardcoded colors in theme toggle code
- Theme toggle is disabled (dark mode only)
- These are intentionally preserved for future reference

### 2. **DiscordPopup.tsx**
- Discord brand colors (#5865F2, #4752C4, #7289DA) preserved
- These are official Discord brand colors and should not use theme tokens

### 3. **TokenTest.tsx**
- Test component excluded from migration
- Used for testing the token system itself

## Migration Integrity

### Total Hardcoded Colors Migrated: 318+
- Phase 1: 135 occurrences
- Phase 2: 35 occurrences
- Phase 3: 54 occurrences
- Phase 4: 56 occurrences
- Phase 5: 38 occurrences (including final cleanup)

### Design Tokens Added During Migration:
- `status-success-hover`
- `status-warning-hover`
- `status-error-hover`
- `bg-hover` (for general hover states)
- Various opacity variations

## Verification Commands Used

```bash
# Primary verification
find src -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.css" | \
  grep -v node_modules | grep -v TokenTest | \
  xargs grep -E "(bg|text|border|divide|ring|placeholder)-(color)-[0-9]"

# Gradient verification
find src -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.css" | \
  grep -v node_modules | grep -v TokenTest | \
  xargs grep -E "(from|to|via)-(color)-[0-9]"

# Focus ring verification
find src -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.css" | \
  grep -v node_modules | grep -v TokenTest | \
  xargs grep -E "focus:ring-(color)-[0-9]"
```

## Conclusion

The Crystal theme migration is **100% COMPLETE**. All active hardcoded colors have been successfully migrated to the design token system. The application now has a consistent, maintainable theming architecture that will support future design system evolution.

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ No active hardcoded colors remain
- ✅ All components use semantic design tokens
- ✅ Dark mode fully supported
- ✅ No regressions in UI appearance
- ✅ Build passes without errors
- ✅ Type safety maintained throughout

This migration establishes a solid foundation for Crystal's design system going forward.
