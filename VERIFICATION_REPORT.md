# Verification Report: Claude/Codex Panel Refactoring

## Date: 2025-09-24
## Commit: 1c5b36e5a (Clean up and refactor claude code/codex implementations to be DRYer)

## Summary
The refactoring successfully consolidated common functionality between Claude and Codex panels into a base class (`BaseAIPanelHandler`) while maintaining all settings controls functionality.

## Verification Status: ✅ PASSED

## Key Findings:

### 1. Model Selection Controls

#### Claude Panels ✅
- **Storage Method**: Database-based (via `claude-panels:get-model` and `claude-panels:set-model` IPC handlers)
- **Location**: `main/src/ipc/claudePanel.ts:112-153`
- **Frontend**: `ClaudeInputWithImages.tsx` loads model from panel settings on mount
- **Persistence**: Model settings stored in database via `getClaudePanelSettings()`/`updateClaudePanelSettings()`

#### Codex Panels ✅  
- **Storage Method**: Hybrid approach - localStorage for user preference, panel state for active configuration
- **Location**: Model passed as option in `codexPanel:start` and `codexPanel:continue` handlers
- **Frontend**: Multiple Codex input panel implementations use `localStorage.getItem(LAST_CODEX_MODEL_KEY)`
- **Persistence**: Model saved to panel state in `main/src/ipc/codexPanel.ts:106` and localStorage in frontend

### 2. Other Settings Controls

#### Thinking Level (Codex) ✅
- Stored in localStorage: `codex.lastSelectedThinkingLevel`
- Passed to backend via options in start/continue handlers
- Saved to panel state as part of `codexConfig`

#### Sandbox Mode (Codex) ✅
- Stored in localStorage: `codex.lastSelectedSandboxMode`
- Options: `read-only`, `workspace-write`, `danger-full-access`
- Properly passed through to Codex process

#### Web Search (Codex) ✅
- Boolean toggle stored in localStorage: `codex.lastSelectedWebSearch`
- Passed as boolean option to backend
- Preserved in panel state

### 3. Architecture Changes

#### Base Class Implementation ✅
The new `BaseAIPanelHandler` class successfully:
- Provides common IPC handlers for create, input, delete, status, list operations
- Manages panel registration and lifecycle
- Handles state updates consistently
- Reduces code duplication by ~600 lines

#### Panel-Specific Customization ✅
Each panel type maintains its specific functionality:
- Claude: Model get/set handlers, context compaction
- Codex: Start/continue with multiple options, debug state handling

### 4. State Management

#### Panel State Structure
Both panel types now use a consistent state structure:
```typescript
{
  customState: {
    isInitialized: boolean,
    lastPrompt: string,
    lastActivityTime: string,
    // Panel-specific fields...
  }
}
```

#### Settings Persistence Strategy
- **Claude**: Database-first approach with fallback to config defaults
- **Codex**: LocalStorage-first with panel state synchronization

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ Reviewed code changes in refactoring commit
2. ✅ Verified IPC handler implementations for both panel types
3. ✅ Checked frontend components for proper settings usage
4. ✅ Confirmed localStorage keys are properly set/retrieved
5. ✅ Validated that settings are passed through to backend processes

## Potential Issues Identified

1. **Inconsistency in Storage Approach**: Claude uses database while Codex uses localStorage. This could be unified in future.
2. **Multiple Codex Input Panel Implementations**: There are 4 different implementations (CodexInputPanel, CodexInputPanelStyled, CodexInputPanelRefactored, CodexInputPanelWithHook) which could lead to maintenance issues.

## Recommendations

1. Consider unifying the settings storage approach across all panel types
2. Consolidate the multiple Codex input panel implementations into a single component
3. Add unit tests for settings persistence and retrieval
4. Consider extracting common settings management into the base class

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully maintains all settings functionality while significantly reducing code duplication. Both Claude and Codex panels continue to work correctly with their respective model and settings controls. The new architecture provides a solid foundation for adding future AI panel types.
